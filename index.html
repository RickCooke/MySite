          <p class="nospace push30"><center>Graduating this year with a bachelors in computer science engineering from the University of Michigan my technical background has never been stronger and only continues to grow. Rigorous coursework taught me the foundations of programming in Java and C++ and the necessity of creating fast, efficient code. During this time I found the more interesting opportunities to be those explored outside the classroom.  Interest in web development led to building static web pages for various student groups on campus and full-stack web apps during hackathons. These projects introduced me to the basics of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and exposed me to technologies such as node.js, and backbone. Developing software in industry was a whole different ball game as I became proficient in developing insightful, innovative, scalable apps on the Android platform. These applications have since been deployed to hundreds of users around the globe and are used every day.  </center></p>
<!--          Through recent expereinces in industry I have noticed some of the biggest problems stem from the difference between customers' desires and outcome. I stand to fix that. My deepest passion has become design and customer oriented development.  Utilizing my communication skills I am able to work with the customer to design products that precisely fit their needs.  Once a preliminary design is in place, my technical bachground allows me to collaborate with development teams of any sort to construct the underlying implementation.  I find that the most rewarding part of any job is delivery to the customer, especially when our product become part of their everyday tools for success.</center></p>-->

        <h2>The University of Michigan</h2>
        <p>Currently a Senior in Computer Science Engineering I am pursuing all elements of computing I find even the slightest interest in to broaden my background.  Through my courses I have become an expert in C/C++ and Java, and am learning HTML/CSS/JS, and PHP.  I have experince with Database management, operating systems, mutithreaded Programming, and computer/internet security.  Outside of the classroom I am engaged in various student organizations and keep myself busy with projects of personal interest.  Currently my interests reside in developing programs to solve everyday problems.  My most recent project is a web applicaiton that allows users to input their course schedule and find what classes they share with their peers (as listed on facebook or through the app itself).  This project came from my recent work as a founding father of the Alpha Sigma chapter of Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity. Here I was appointed alumni and parent relations board and hold a char on the Academic Committee.  This experience has provided me with the unique opporunity to network with Alumni from all across the country to plan events.  I have also discovered an interest in front end development and design. I have worked with various groups on campus to develop websites.  I am currently developing sites for Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity, UM::Autonomy, and Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles.</p>

        <h1>The Boeing Company</h1>
        <h6>Mobile Software Developer</h6>
          <p>This past summer I was working as a software developer for Boeing's Mobile Solutions group in Seattle. During my time here I was given challenge of developing two entirely different apps, both of which required my undivided attention. The challenge was matched with a strong desire to learn and code as much as I could. One of the projects was a mapping application that would allow users to find any company building and use google maps' API to provide turn-by-turn directions to it. Once at the building a user could then look at the conference rooms available in the building based on availability and features. A handy feature in an overcrowded office space. My other project is mostly proprietary but involved the dynamic drawing of custom UI components as well as the design of the supporting API. Both of these applications were developed for the Android platform using native Java and XML. </p>
          <h6>Program Manager</h6>
            <p>The summer before this I worked with Boeing's Mobile Solutions group in Southern California as a Program Manager developing mobile technologies to increase efficiency in a manufacturing environment. This role allowed me to design new applications for iOS, Android and other mobile platforms as well as support existing products. I was also able to contribute to use cases of future technologies such as wearable computing (i.e. Google Glass, Kopin Golden-i, etc.). Much of this experience also came with the opportunity to network with customers both within and outside of Boeing.  This included meeting with customers to develop specifications for new applications that would be used throughout the enterprise.</p> <p>This internship culminated when I was presented with the opportunity to organize a regional technology fair for Boeing Southern California. Using the network I had developed working with various development teams I was able to recruit business teams from across the industry to showcase their product. Through my efforts this event showcased more technologies than ever before and had much higher attendance than any technology fair prior.</p>

        <h1>ETAS</h1>
        <h6>Embeded Software Developer</h6>
        <p>During the summer of 2013, I worked with ETAS, an embeded software subsidiary of Bosch. Here I worked with embedded technologies modifying an existing product to meet new industry standards.  This work gave me experience with both hardware and software and exposed me to many new technologies including microprocessors and hardware debugging tools. I also developed several Perl scripts to automatically update information in the company's data sheets. </p> <p>During my time with the company it was my responsibility to document all changes to the software and differences in the emerging system architecture. I later presented these changes and how to use the product in this new architecture to a board of international executives. At the end of my internship I received top excellence awards for technical documentation and presentation.</p>

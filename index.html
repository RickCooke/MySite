        <p class="nospace push30"><center>As a computer science engineer at the University of Michigan, I have developed a strong technical background in various technologies and coding languages.  Through recent expereinces in idustry my newest passion has become design and customer oriented development.  Utilizing my communication skills my focus was to establish relationships with the customer and design products that exactly fit their needs.  Once a preliminary design is in place my technical bachground allows me to collaborate with development teams of any sort to construct the underlying implementation.  I find that the most reqarding part of any job is delivery to the customer, especially when our product become part of their everyday tool set.</center></p>

        <h2>The University of Michigan</h2>
        <p>Currently a Junior in Computer Science Engineering I am pursuing all elements of computing I find even the slightest interest in to broaden my background.  Through my courses I have become proficent in C/C++, Java, and Database Management Systems.  Outside of the classroom I am engaged in various student organizations as well as keep myself busy with projects of personal interest.  As part of the <a href="www.maavumich.org">Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles</a> team I worked on the imaging and navigation algorithms.  Specifically I helped update old code and worked with the team lead to develop a new height tracking algorithm. This year I am also joining the <a href="http://www.umautonomy.com/">Michigan Autonomy</a> team where I will aid both the business and imaging and navigation team.  I am also teaching myself how to interface with low level sensors and microprocessors and am starting projects within <a href="http://michiganhackers.org/">Michgan Hackers</a> to make my residence a "smart house".  In addition to updating and adding more features to this site as I become more familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, check back here for updates and pictures of these projects! </p>

        <h1>The Boeing Company</h1>
        <h6>Mobility Software Developer and Support Team Member</h6>
        <!-- During my most recent internship I worked with Boeing's Mobility IT group developing mobile technologies to increase efficiency in a manugacturing enviornment. -->
        <p>During my most recent internship I worked with Boeing's Mobility IT group developing mobile technologies to increase efficiency in a manufacturing environment. This role allowed me to develop new applications for iOS, Android and other mobile platforms as well as support existing products. I was also able to contribute to use cases of future technologies such as wearable computing (i.e. Google Glass, Kopin Golden-i, etc.). Much of this experience also came with the opportunity to network with customers both within and outside of Boeing.  This included meeting with customers to develop specifications for new applications that would be used throughout the enterprise.</p> <p>This internship culminated when I was presented with the opportunity to organize a regional technology fair for Boeing Southern California. Using the network I had developed working with various development teams I was able to recruit business teams from across the industry to showcase their product. Through my efforts this event showcased more technologies than ever before and had much higher attendance than any technology fair prior.</p>

        <h1>ETAS</h1>
        <h6>Embeded Software Developer</h6>
        <p>During the summer of 2013, I worked with ETAS, an embeded software subsidiary of Bosch. Here I worked with embedded technologies modifying an existing product to meet new industry standards.  This work gave me experience with both hardware and software and exposed me to many new technologies including microprocessors and hardware debugging tools. I also developed several Perl scripts to automatically update information in the company's data sheets. </p> <p>During my time with the company it was my responsibility to document all changes to the software and differences in the emerging system architecture. I later presented these changes and how to use the product in this new architecture to a board of international executives. At the end of my internship I received top excellence awards for technical documentation and presentation.</p>

		During my time with the company it was my responsibility to document changes to the software and differences in the emerging system architecture
		Get rid of "most employees were unfamiliar with..."
		Move the bit about perl scripts right after the second sentence
		"I received top excellence award for techinical documentation and presentation"
